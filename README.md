## Exception exercises

### 1. CakeDivision
There are two possible errors that could occur when running the CakeDivision() procedure in Program.cs.<br/>
Try running the code with different inputs to find out what these would be.<br/>
Then add exception handling code to handle these two cases.<br/>

### 2. ReadDiary
The ReadDiary() procedure in Program.cs reads events from Files\DiaryEvents.csv and outputs them to the console.<br>
It calls the Diary.ReadDiaryEvents() function to do this.<br/>
If you run the code you should see that it works fine.<br/>
However the code is a little less robust than it was previously.<br/>
There are no checks to see if the file exists, if lines have the right number of fields or if fields can be parsed (converted from a string to the required format)<br/>
Try changing DiaryEvents.csv in different ways to see how many different errors you can get<br/>
You might wish to try an extra header line, changing the number of fields, changing the file location and changing the format or order of the strings in turn<br/>
Now add exception handling code which will output messages to the user telling them about the different errors that have occured.<br/>

### 3. DetermineHouse
The DetermineHouse() procedure in Program.cs takes user input and converts this to a House enum. It then outputs the result.<br>
It calls the SortingHat.FindHouse() function to do this.<br/>
At the moment House.Syltherin will be returned if the input string is not recognised as a house.<br>
Change the code in SortingHat.FindHouse() so that it throws a suitable exception instead.<br>
The calling code should handle this exception and output a suitable message.<br/>
